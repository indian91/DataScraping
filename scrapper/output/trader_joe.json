        "description": " Combining two iconically Japanese ingredients into one uniquely delicious sauce, Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread is a curiously captivating condiment, unlike any other we\u2019ve offered before. On tasting it, you\u2019ll likely first notice its rich, luxuriously thick consistency, then the savory, umami-filled notes of its white miso paste base, which perfectly leads into the pleasantly tart tones of its mixed-in yuzu zest and yuzu juice. Then, once you\u2019ve had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it..   And indeed, the possibilities are practically endless: it\u2019s spectacular spread over grilled seafood, it\u2019s stupendous on a seared steak, and it adds remarkable depth of flavor to roast chicken. But that\u2019s just the beginning. From the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries or Organic Chicken Nuggets) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication.

        "description": " You\u2019ve probably heard of kombucha, and maybe you\u2019ve heard of kefir... but have you heard of water kefir? If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Made for us by a renowned Wisconsin creamery that\u2019s known for their sharp, rich Cheddars, a trio of hot chili peppers is mixed into every batch of Trader Joe\u2019s Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar Cheese before the whole wheel is smoked over aromatic hickory. Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalape\u00f1o, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully (though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.   A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited. To paraphrase an old adage, the cheese that burns twice as hot lasts half as long on the shelf! ",

Then, once you\u2019ve had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it..   And indeed, the possibilities are practically endless: it\u2019s spectacular spread over grilled seafood, it\u2019s stupendous on a seared steak, and it adds remarkable depth of flavor to roast chicken. But that\u2019s just the beginning. From the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries or Organic Chicken Nuggets) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin.

Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich.

        "description": " An \u201cOld World Recipe\u201d for the new age shopper, Trader Joe\u2019s Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins are an elegantly simple, refreshing, and flavor-filled treat. Using real Meyer lemon oils, these Cookie Thins exhibit the allure of this sought after lemon variety. Without the tang of \u201cregular\u201d lemons, Meyer lemons are a much more mellow sweetness that lends itself wonderfully to baking and using in sweeter applications than traditional lemon varieties.   Taking a simple recipe, real citrus flavor, and baking it into graceful little crisps with delicately scalloped edges, Trader Joe\u2019s Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins are bound to put a pleasant pucker on your lips. And don\u2019t think of them as exclusively a saccharine snack option, consider using with a few of our quirky cheeses or dips such as our Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese, Everything but the Bagel Greek Style Yogurt Dip, or our Authentic Lemon Curd.

Originating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile we draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they\u2019re generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends. Any way you slice it, Pizza Seasoned Crackers make for fun and flavorful munchies whenever you\u2019re feeling peckish! ",

A certified phenom. And for the newest addition to our frozen entr\u00e9e assortment, we\u2019re drawing inspiration from one of the greatest hits of them all: lo mein. Made for us by a longtime supplier in Thailand who specializes in succulent shrimp dishes, Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein offers all the same rich aromatics, savory flavors, and tantalizingly toothsome textures that made lo mein such a legend in the first place.   Inside each package of Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein, you\u2019ll find a pack of wheat noodles, a medley of veggies including white cabbage and bell peppers, and a pouch of raw shrimp in a savory ginger-shiitake sauce. All it takes is a few minutes of saut\u00e9eing in a skillet for these ingredients to go from frozen to steamy, fragrant, and ready to eat. Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalape\u00f1o, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully (though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.   A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

Since its invention in the 1920s, the Caesar has reigned supreme as a scion of salad- dom \u2014 although, full disclosure, it actually gets its name from its reported inventor, chef Caesar Cardini; any similarities to Roman emperors are purely coincidental. And for close to three decades, Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken has remained a staple of our salad selection. Inspired by the classic recipe, it\u2019s made with crisp Romaine lettuce, fresh shreds of Parmesan, crunchy croutons, and tender chunks of chicken breast, with a packet of zesty, creamy, and triumphantly garlicky Caesar dressing included.   Once mixed together, this Salad exhibits everything you love about the iconic Caesar profile \u2014 the crunch, the rich flavors, the savory notes of garlic and anchovy \u2014 all in one conveniently portable package. Perhaps it\u2019s the princely air that comes with enjoying such a sumptuous salad in a mundane setting, but even after all these years, it remains one of our favorite lunch salads to bring to work. Keep an eye out for nine ounce packages of Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken in our refrigerators the next time you\u2019re looking to conquer your hunger. ",

Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.   Carrot Mini Sheet Cake is available in our bakery section for a limited time, so make haste to your neighborhood Trader Joe\u2019s! ",

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

Once mixed together, this Salad exhibits everything you love about the iconic Caesar profile \u2014 the crunch, the rich flavors, the savory notes of garlic and anchovy \u2014 all in one conveniently portable package. Perhaps it\u2019s the princely air that comes with enjoying such a sumptuous salad in a mundane setting, but even after all these years, it remains one of our favorite lunch salads to bring to work.

True to the source material, they\u2019re generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.   Carrot Mini Sheet Cake is available in our bakery section for a limited time, so make haste to your neighborhood Trader Joe\u2019s! ",

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication.

It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited.

        "description": " Combining two iconically Japanese ingredients into one uniquely delicious sauce, Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread is a curiously captivating condiment, unlike any other we\u2019ve offered before. On tasting it, you\u2019ll likely first notice its rich, luxuriously thick consistency, then the savory, umami-filled notes of its white miso paste base, which perfectly leads into the pleasantly tart tones of its mixed-in yuzu zest and yuzu juice. Then, once you\u2019ve had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it..   And indeed, the possibilities are practically endless: it\u2019s spectacular spread over grilled seafood, it\u2019s stupendous on a seared steak, and it adds remarkable depth of flavor to roast chicken. But that\u2019s just the beginning. From the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries or Organic Chicken Nuggets) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich.

        "description": " You\u2019ve probably heard of kombucha, and maybe you\u2019ve heard of kefir... but have you heard of water kefir? If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Made for us by a renowned Wisconsin creamery that\u2019s known for their sharp, rich Cheddars, a trio of hot chili peppers is mixed into every batch of Trader Joe\u2019s Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar Cheese before the whole wheel is smoked over aromatic hickory. Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalape\u00f1o, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully (though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.   A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited. To paraphrase an old adage, the cheese that burns twice as hot lasts half as long on the shelf! ",

But that\u2019s just the beginning. From the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries or Organic Chicken Nuggets) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe\u2019s Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.

Taking a simple recipe, real citrus flavor, and baking it into graceful little crisps with delicately scalloped edges, Trader Joe\u2019s Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins are bound to put a pleasant pucker on your lips. And don\u2019t think of them as exclusively a saccharine snack option, consider using with a few of our quirky cheeses or dips such as our Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese, Everything but the Bagel Greek Style Yogurt Dip, or our Authentic Lemon Curd.

        "description": " Trader Joe\u2019s Pizza Seasoned Crackers are the mini, snackable version of pizza you didn\u2019t know you needed!   Originating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile we draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they\u2019re generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends. Any way you slice it, Pizza Seasoned Crackers make for fun and flavorful munchies whenever you\u2019re feeling peckish! ",

A certified phenom. And for the newest addition to our frozen entr\u00e9e assortment, we\u2019re drawing inspiration from one of the greatest hits of them all: lo mein. Made for us by a longtime supplier in Thailand who specializes in succulent shrimp dishes, Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein offers all the same rich aromatics, savory flavors, and tantalizingly toothsome textures that made lo mein such a legend in the first place.   Inside each package of Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein, you\u2019ll find a pack of wheat noodles, a medley of veggies including white cabbage and bell peppers, and a pouch of raw shrimp in a savory ginger-shiitake sauce. All it takes is a few minutes of saut\u00e9eing in a skillet for these ingredients to go from frozen to steamy, fragrant, and ready to eat. Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalape\u00f1o, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully (though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.   A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin.

Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich.

        "description": " Hail, Caesar Salad! Since its invention in the 1920s, the Caesar has reigned supreme as a scion of salad- dom \u2014 although, full disclosure, it actually gets its name from its reported inventor, chef Caesar Cardini; any similarities to Roman emperors are purely coincidental. And for close to three decades, Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken has remained a staple of our salad selection. Inspired by the classic recipe, it\u2019s made with crisp Romaine lettuce, fresh shreds of Parmesan, crunchy croutons, and tender chunks of chicken breast, with a packet of zesty, creamy, and triumphantly garlicky Caesar dressing included.   Once mixed together, this Salad exhibits everything you love about the iconic Caesar profile \u2014 the crunch, the rich flavors, the savory notes of garlic and anchovy \u2014 all in one conveniently portable package. Perhaps it\u2019s the princely air that comes with enjoying such a sumptuous salad in a mundane setting, but even after all these years, it remains one of our favorite lunch salads to bring to work. Keep an eye out for nine ounce packages of Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken in our refrigerators the next time you\u2019re looking to conquer your hunger. ",

True to the source material, they\u2019re generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

Made for us by a longtime supplier in Thailand who specializes in succulent shrimp dishes, Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein offers all the same rich aromatics, savory flavors, and tantalizingly toothsome textures that made lo mein such a legend in the first place.   Inside each package of Trader Joe\u2019s Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein, you\u2019ll find a pack of wheat noodles, a medley of veggies including white cabbage and bell peppers, and a pouch of raw shrimp in a savory ginger-shiitake sauce. All it takes is a few minutes of saut\u00e9eing in a skillet for these ingredients to go from frozen to steamy, fragrant, and ready to eat. Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited.

Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb.

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

And for close to three decades, Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken has remained a staple of our salad selection. Inspired by the classic recipe, it\u2019s made with crisp Romaine lettuce, fresh shreds of Parmesan, crunchy croutons, and tender chunks of chicken breast, with a packet of zesty, creamy, and triumphantly garlicky Caesar dressing included.   Once mixed together, this Salad exhibits everything you love about the iconic Caesar profile \u2014 the crunch, the rich flavors, the savory notes of garlic and anchovy \u2014 all in one conveniently portable package. Perhaps it\u2019s the princely air that comes with enjoying such a sumptuous salad in a mundane setting, but even after all these years, it remains one of our favorite lunch salads to bring to work. Keep an eye out for nine ounce packages of Trader Joe\u2019s Caesar Salad with Chicken in our refrigerators the next time you\u2019re looking to conquer your hunger. ",

True to the source material, they\u2019re generously seasoned with the pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

All it takes is a few minutes of saut\u00e9eing in a skillet for these ingredients to go from frozen to steamy, fragrant, and ready to eat. Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entr\u00e9e for one or two, or combined with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby Broccoli, and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers.

If not, the shelves of Trader Joe\u2019s just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma. It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla.

Once harvested, they\u2019re carefully dried in the summer sun by our trusted Turkish apricot supplier (and by Mother Nature, of course). What really makes these Dried Apricots Simply Amazing is the final step, which involves a gentle steaming. This unique method yields unbelievably Soft Apricots with a tender, chewy, almost velvety texture. Each bite of these reddish gems presents a floral, candy-like quality that is tempered by a pleasant tang.   Because they are harvest-dependent, we\u2019re offering Trader Joe\u2019s Simply Amazing Soft Dried Apricots only for a limited time.

        "description": " Whose idea was it to put carrot in a cake anyway? In Medieval Europe, sugar was so inaccessible that the populace had to get creative with satisfying its sweet tooth. Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots got the job done\u2014and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, Trader Joe\u2019s festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite.   Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend just enough bite to contrast the cake\u2019s moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture.   There\u2019s no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life.   Carrot Mini Sheet Cake is available in our bakery section for a limited time, so make haste to your neighborhood Trader Joe\u2019s! ",

Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no fat. Shocking, really, once you\u2019ve tasted it.   How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That\u2019s entirely up to you, of course, but we\u2019re happy to start you off with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini. ",

Thin, wheat-based Crackers stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to the real deal.   To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your cheese of choice\u2014we\u2019re partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Add cold cheese slices for a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs and cozy gatherings with family and friends.

It comes to us from the folks at GT\u2019s\u00ae. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava pur\u00e9e (along with a bit of habanero juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.   Each bottle of Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir \u201cgrains,\u201d which are actually grain-free, dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these \u201cgrains\u201d are placed in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & \u201cregular\u201d kefir\u2014the dairy kind\u2014come from similar processes, but the kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic properties, we\u2019re happy to report that Agua de Kefir\u2122 Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a strenuous yoga session. ",

Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalape\u00f1o, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully (though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.   A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it\u2019s especially suited, however, for shredding and sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar before it\u2019s too late, because supplies are limited. To paraphrase an old adage, the cheese that burns twice as hot lasts half as long on the shelf! ",
