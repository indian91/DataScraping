Taking the scenic route, this specialty coffee leads you to its fruity, spicy flavors and citrus and chocolate notes. A blend of great precision, thanks in particular to the two farms chosen: one committed to quality in the world's largest coffee-producing country, the other believing in a culture that welcomes what the earth gives it, without human intervention or added products.",

There's something magical about this elixir, if only because of its history: it takes you on a journey to Africa, the cradle of coffee. A mythical journey, from Ethiopia to Rwanda via Kenya. The roaster, too, is a bit of a magician, disappearing into the background to make room for the taste of the product and its origins. He chooses a gentle, light roasting to bring out the natural sweetness and acidity of the fruit. An ode to the raw material and the land from which it comes.",

We're offering you the quite extraordinary experience of enjoying a smooth, singular beverage, caffeine-free, but with flavors wonderfully in line with what you'd expect from coffee, fair and balanced, with just the right amount of bitterness and acidity. And we didn't do things by halves just because you're a bit fussy. We went all the way to Colombia, and even climbed up to La Fabrica, a Colombian farm in the Tolima region. It's up there, on these high-altitude plots, draped in mist and clouds, that a community of coffee growers, comprising over 200 families, cultivates coffee with great care. Each fruit is hand-picked, cherry by cherry. And cherry on top (of the coffee), a second selection is made after harvesting, to ensure that only the very best is kept! The fruit is then fermented with natural yeasts before being dried, milled and decaffeinated. And there you have it! These beans can be prepared as an espresso for greater intensity, or as a filter for more lightness: it's time for a decaf break!",

We're heading for Ethiopia, the cradle of coffee for centuries, to the Yirgacheffe region, which produces some of the world's best-loved coffees. No doubt the plants feel at home in their native land, in a highly favorable environment, allowing them to flourish in the best possible way.

Full-bodied, smooth and creamy flavors, with incredible complexity and fruity notes of mirabelle plum, red berries and physalis, thanks to the cherry\u2019s sugar absorbed by the bean during all these stages.
